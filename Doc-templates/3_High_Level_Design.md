## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the high-level design of the Simulation-Based Greenhouse Control Optimization system. It bridges the gap between the project's refined requirements (derived from the initial problem statement and facilitation report) and the detailed technical implementation. It describes the major system components, their interactions, and the data flows required to evaluate optimized greenhouse control strategies using simulation and multi-objective optimization techniques.

### 1.2 Scope

This HLD covers:

- The core software components and their responsibilities (Data Access, Input Preparation, Simulation, MOEA, Logging).
- Interactions between these internal components.
- The principal data flows, focusing on the use of historical data and simulation results.
- An overview of the primary technologies (Rust, TimescaleDB, Docker) and algorithmic approaches (Plant Simulation, MOEA).
- Key architectural decisions aligned with an iterative development methodology.

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 System Context

The Simulation-Based Greenhouse Control Optimization system operates primarily on historical data stored in a TimescaleDB database. It aims to find potentially optimal control strategies (e.g., lighting plans) by simulating plant growth responses and balancing them against estimated energy costs.

- **Input:** Historical environmental data (temperature, humidity, COâ‚‚, lighting, potentially energy prices) from TimescaleDB.
- **Processing:** A Rust application orchestrates data retrieval, simulation execution, and multi-objective optimization.
- **Output:** A set of non-dominated control strategies representing trade-offs between energy cost and simulated plant growth, along with process logs.
- **Environment:** Designed to run within Docker containers for consistency and portability.

This system does *not* directly interact with live sensors or actuators in a real greenhouse. Its focus is on *offline analysis and strategy evaluation* based on past data and simulation.

### 2.2 Design Goals

The design aims to:

- Implement a modular and testable architecture suitable for iterative development.
- Ensure efficient processing of historical data and execution of simulation/optimization tasks.
- Integrate established concepts for plant growth simulation and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs).
- Provide clear logging for analyzing the simulation and optimization process.
- Address the core project aim: demonstrating trade-offs between energy cost and simulated plant growth.
- Adhere strictly to the defined scope for a Master's thesis project, acknowledging limitations (e.g., qualitative simulation validation).

## 3. Process Flow Diagrams

### 3.1 Core Data & Processing Flow

The following diagram represents the primary data and processing flow within the system:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[TimescaleDB: Historical Data] --> B(Data Access Module - Rust);
    B --> C(Input Preparation Module - Rust);
    C -- Environmental Inputs & Config --> D(Plant Simulation Module - Rust);
    D -- Simulated Growth Metrics --> E(Multi-Objective Optimization Module MOEA - Rust);
    C -- Energy Cost Data/Params --> E;
    E -- Iterative Evaluation --> D;
    E -- Non-dominated Strategies --> F(Output/Logging Module - Rust);
    F --> G[Output Files / Logs];

    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style G fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

*Diagram Interpretation:* Historical data is accessed and prepared. The simulation module uses environmental inputs to generate simulated growth metrics. The MOEA module uses these metrics and energy cost data to evaluate potential control strategies, iteratively calling the simulation. Finally, the MOEA outputs a set of optimal trade-off strategies, which are logged.

### 3.2 High-Level Iteration Loop (Conceptual)

```mermaid
graph LR
    Start --> GetData(Access Historical Data);
    GetData --> PrepareInput(Prepare Simulation Inputs);
    PrepareInput --> RunSim(Run Plant Simulation);
    RunSim --> CalcObjectives(Calculate Objectives: Sim Growth, Energy Cost);
    CalcObjectives --> RunMOEA(Execute MOEA Step);
    RunMOEA --> CheckConvergence{Convergence Met?};
    CheckConvergence -- No --> RunSim;
    CheckConvergence -- Yes --> OutputResults(Log Optimal Strategies);
    OutputResults --> End;

```

*Diagram Interpretation:* This shows the conceptual flow within the optimization process, highlighting the loop between simulation, objective calculation, and the MOEA until convergence criteria are met.

## 6. Data Design

### 6.1 Key Data Structures

- **Historical Environmental Data:** Represents time-series records from TimescaleDB (timestamp, temperature, humidity, CO2, light levels, potentially energy price).
- **Simulation Input:** Structured data required by the simulation model for a given time step or period.
- **Simulation Output:** Metrics representing simulated plant growth (e.g., biomass accumulation rate).
- **Control Strategy Representation:** Defines the parameters being optimized (e.g., a schedule for supplemental lighting intensity/duration).
- **Optimization Result:** A set of non-dominated control strategies, each associated with its objective values (simulated growth, energy cost).
- **Configuration Data:** Parameters for the simulation model, MOEA (population size, generations, etc.), and objective functions (e.g., energy cost calculation).

### 6.2 Data Flow Strategy

- **Batch Processing:** The system operates primarily in a batch mode, processing chunks of historical data to evaluate strategies over a defined period.
- **Internal Data Passing:** Data flows between Rust modules primarily through in-memory structures (structs, enums).
- **Input/Output:** Input is read from TimescaleDB; Configuration potentially from files (e.g., TOML, YAML); Output is written to log files and result files.
- **Data Persistence:** The primary persistent store is TimescaleDB for input. Intermediate states within the optimization are generally transient. Final results are persisted to files.

## 8. Non-Functional Aspects

### 8.1 Performance

- **Processing Time:** Optimization runs should complete within a reasonable timeframe suitable for research and analysis (specifics TBD, depends on data size, simulation complexity, MOEA parameters).
- **Resource Utilization:** Should operate within typical constraints of a modern development machine or server environment (memory, CPU).

### 8.2 Reliability & Robustness

- **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of database connection issues, file I/O errors, invalid configuration, and potential numerical issues in simulation/optimization.
- **Reproducibility:** Given the same input data, configuration, and software version, the optimization process should yield comparable results (acknowledging the stochastic nature of MOEAs).

### 8.3 Maintainability & Testability

- **Modularity:** Adherence to the modular design to facilitate testing and future modifications.
- **Code Quality:** Follow Rust best practices (idiomatic code, documentation, testing).
- **Testing:** Unit tests for core logic (simulation, objective functions) and integration tests between modules are essential. End-to-end tests using specific historical data scenarios will validate overall functionality.

### 8.4 Simulation Validity (NFR-6)

- **Qualitative Validation:** The simulation model's behavior will be validated qualitatively against established horticultural principles and literature (e.g., response to light, temperature). Quantitative calibration against specific, real plant growth data is *out of scope*. Model limitations will be documented.
