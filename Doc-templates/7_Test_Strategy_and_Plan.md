import { describe, test, beforeEach, expect } from "bun:test";
import { ClimateController } from "greenhouse/control";

describe("ClimateController", () => {
  let controller: ClimateController;

  beforeEach((): void => {
    controller = new ClimateController();
  });

  test("temperature control", (): void => {
    // Implementation to test temperature control functionality
    expect(true).toBe(true);
  });

  test("humidity control", (): void => {
    // Implementation to test humidity control functionality
    expect(true).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

      metrics: this.testMetrics,
      results: Object.fromEntries(this.testResults)
    }, null, 2);
  }

  private updateMetrics(results: TestResult[]): void {
    this.testMetrics.totalTests += results.length;
    this.testMetrics.passedTests += results.filter(r => r.passed).length;
