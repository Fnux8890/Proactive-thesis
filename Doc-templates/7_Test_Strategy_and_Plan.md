## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document defines the testing strategy and plan for the Simulation-Based Greenhouse Control Optimization system. It aims to ensure that the core Rust application meets its functional requirements, performs adequately for analysis, and handles data correctly according to the project objectives defined in the Facilitation Report.

### 1.2 Scope

This test plan covers the testing phases relevant to the offline, simulation-based nature of the project:

- Unit Testing (Rust components)
- Integration Testing (Rust module interactions, Database interaction)
- System Testing (End-to-end workflow validation)
- Performance Testing (Simulation and Optimization runtime)
- Robustness Testing (Error handling)

*Note: Testing related to live hardware, real-time control, user interfaces, or extensive external APIs is out of scope.*

## 2. Test Strategy

### 2.1 Testing Objectives

- **Validate Core Logic:** Ensure simulation model calculations, MOEA objective functions, and data processing logic are correct.
- **Verify Component Integration:** Confirm that Rust modules (Data Access, Input Prep, Simulation, MOEA, Logging) interact as designed.
- **Confirm Data Handling:** Validate correct retrieval from TimescaleDB and processing of historical data.
- **Assess Performance:** Measure the runtime performance of simulation and optimization processes for feasibility.
- **Ensure Robustness:** Test error handling for database connections, file I/O, and invalid configurations.
- **Verify Output Correctness:** Ensure logged results and output files accurately reflect the optimization outcomes.

### 2.2 Testing Types

1. **Unit Testing**
2. **Integration Testing**
3. **System Testing**
4. **Performance Testing**
5. **Robustness Testing**

### 2.3 Testing Approach

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD) Principles:** Where practical, write tests for Rust functions before or during implementation.
- **Automated Testing:** Leverage Rust's built-in testing framework (`cargo test`) for unit and integration tests.
- **Scenario-Based System Testing:** Define specific end-to-end scenarios using historical data subsets to validate the full workflow.
- **Manual Verification:** Manually inspect output logs and result files for correctness in system tests.
- **Simulation-Based Validation:** Use controlled input scenarios to qualitatively validate the simulation model's behavior (as per NFR-6).

## 3. Test Environment

### 3.1 Hardware Requirements

- Development machine capable of running Rust compilation, Docker, and the application.
- Access to a TimescaleDB instance (local Docker container or remote).

### 3.2 Software Requirements

```yaml
Development/Testing:
  - Rust (Compiler & Toolchain >= [Specify Version])
  - cargo test (Rust's built-in testing framework)
  - Python (>= [Specify Version, e.g., 3.10+])
  - uv (Package manager/virtual environment tool)
  - pytest (Testing framework)
  - coverage.py (Test coverage measurement)
  - TimescaleDB (Database instance)
  - Docker (for environment consistency & potentially DB)
  - sqlx-cli (Optional, for DB migrations/setup)
  - Git (Version control)

Potentially Useful Crates for Testing:
  - assert_cmd (for testing CLI behavior if applicable)
  - insta (for snapshot testing outputs)
  - mockall / faux (for mocking dependencies)
```

### 3.3 Test Data Requirements

- Representative samples of historical environmental data (CSV or SQL dump format for TimescaleDB).
- Sample configuration files (e.g., TOML, YAML) covering valid and invalid scenarios.
- Predefined simulation parameters and MOEA settings for specific test cases.
- Expected output structures/formats for validation.

## 4. Unit Testing

### 4.1 Framework

Unit tests will be written using the `pytest` framework and standard Python conventions (e.g., test functions prefixed with `test_`, potentially using test classes).

```python
# Example test structure using pytest

import pytest
import numpy as np
# from your_module import calculate_growth_metric # Import function/class to test

def test_simulation_calculation():
    # Setup test data and parameters
    # input_data = ...
    # params = ...
    # expected_output = ...

    # Call the function under test
    # result = calculate_growth_metric(input_data, params)

    # Assert expected outcome (using pytest assertions)
    # assert result == expected_output
    # For floating point comparisons:
    # assert result == pytest.approx(expected_output, abs=1e-6)
    assert True # Placeholder

def test_objective_function():
    # Test MOEA objective function calculation
    # ...
    assert True # Placeholder

# Example using a test class
# class TestSimulation:
#     def test_some_aspect(self):
#         assert True
```

### 4.2 Test Coverage Goals

- **Target Coverage:** Aim for high coverage (>80%) on critical logic (simulation core, MOEA objectives, data transformations). Use tools like `coverage.py` (often integrated with `pytest-cov`) to measure coverage.
- **Error Handling:** Ensure exception paths (e.g., invalid data, calculation errors) are tested using `pytest.raises`.
- **Edge Cases:** Include tests for boundary conditions (e.g., zero/max values, empty inputs).

---

## 5. Integration Testing

### 5.1 Integration Test Plan

Integration tests will verify interactions *between* the core Python modules/classes and with the database.

1. **Data Access <-> TimescaleDB:**
    - Test database connection logic.
    - Verify correct data retrieval for specific time ranges/conditions.
    - Test handling of database errors (e.g., connection refused, table not found).
2. **Data Access -> Input Preparation:**
    - Test that Input Prep correctly processes data structures received from Data Access.
3. **Input Preparation -> Simulation / MOEA:**
    - Test that Simulation and MOEA modules correctly receive and interpret prepared data and configuration.
4. **MOEA <-> Simulation:**
    - Test the invocation loop: MOEA requesting simulation runs, Simulation returning results.
5. **MOEA / Simulation -> Logging:**
    - Test that logs are generated in the expected format and location using Python's `logging` handlers.

### 5.2 Database Integration Testing

- Use a dedicated test database (potentially ephemeral via Docker).
- Write tests that insert known data, run a component that reads/writes, and assert the database state or returned data.
- Utilize Python libraries for database interaction within tests.

## 6. System Testing

### 6.1 End-to-End Workflow Testing

Focus on validating the complete process flow from input to output.

- **Scenario 1: Basic Run:**
  - Use a small, well-defined historical dataset and configuration.
  - Run the application.
  - **Verify:** Correct output files (results, logs) are generated; results seem plausible based on inputs; no crashes or critical errors logged.
- **Scenario 2: Different Configurations:**
  - Run with varied simulation parameters or MOEA settings.
  - **Verify:** Output reflects the change in configuration; system handles different settings correctly.
- **Scenario 3: Longer Historical Period:**
  - Use a larger dataset covering a longer time span.
  - **Verify:** Application completes successfully; performance is acceptable (see Performance Testing).

### 6.2 Qualitative Simulation Validation (NFR-6 Test)

- Run the system with specific input scenarios designed to test expected simulation behavior (e.g., increasing light levels, varying temperature).
- Analyze the output `SimulationOutput` metrics from the Python implementation.
- **Verify:** The simulated growth responds qualitatively as expected based on horticultural principles (e.g., growth increases with light up to saturation, shows an optimal temperature range). Document results.

## 7. Performance Testing

### 7.1 Test Scenarios

- **Simulation Speed Test:** Measure the average time taken for a single `run_simulation` call (in the Python implementation) over the evaluation period.
- **MOEA Run Time Test:** Measure the total execution time for a complete optimization run with typical parameters (population size, generations) and a representative dataset size.

### 7.2 Acceptance Criteria

- **Simulation Speed (Python):** The initial Python implementation's speed per run must allow the overall optimization to meet NFR-1.1. If not, this triggers consideration of the Rust/FFI optimization, which would then also need performance testing.
- **Total Runtime:** Optimization should complete within a reasonable timeframe for research analysis (e.g., target < Y hours for a standard scenario). *(Specific targets TBD)*

---

## 8. Robustness Testing

### 8.1 Test Scenarios

- **Invalid Configuration:** Provide malformed or incomplete configuration files (TOML/YAML). **Verify:** Application exits gracefully with informative error messages.
- **Database Unavailability:** Attempt to run the application when the TimescaleDB instance is not reachable. **Verify:** Application handles connection errors gracefully and logs appropriately.
- **File System Errors:** Test scenarios like lack of write permissions for the output directory. **Verify:** Application reports file system errors clearly.
- **Invalid Input Data:** Test with historical data containing unexpected values or formats (if possible to simulate). **Verify:** Input Preparation or Simulation handles potential data issues robustly.

## 9. Defect Management

### 9.1 Defect Categories

1. **Critical:** Prevents core functionality (e.g., crash during simulation, incorrect MOEA results, data corruption).
2. **High:** Major functional issue (e.g., significantly incorrect calculation, failure to log results).
3. **Medium:** Minor functional issue, incorrect logging format, usability problem for configuration.
4. **Low:** Typo in logs, minor deviation from expected output format.

### 9.2 Defect Tracking

- Use GitHub Issues to log, track, and manage defects discovered during testing. Assign priority labels based on the categories above.
