## 3. Digital Twin Framework

### 3.1 Twin Model Structure

The digital twin maintains a virtual representation of the greenhouse. A simplified Python class structure is shown below:

```typescript
export class GreenhouseTwin {
  private zones: string[];
  private sensors: Map<string, any>;
  private actuators: Map<string, any>;
  private environmentalState: Map<string, any>;
  private historicalData: any[];

  constructor() {
    this.zones = [];
    this.sensors = new Map();
    this.actuators = new Map();
    this.environmentalState = new Map();
    this.historicalData = [];
  }

  public updateState(sensorData: any): void {
    /**
     * Update the virtual state using real-time sensor data.
     */
    // Update logic goes here
  }

  public predictNextState(controlActions: any): any {
    /**
     * Predict the next environmental state based on provided control actions.
     */
    // Prediction logic goes here
    return null;
  }

  public validateActions(proposedActions: any): boolean {
    /**
     * Validate control actions against safety and system constraints.
     */
    // Validation logic goes here
    return true;
  }
}
```

### 3.2 State Synchronization

To maintain alignment with the real system, the digital twin uses:

- **Real-Time Data Integration:** Regularly updates state with live sensor feeds.
- **State Estimation Algorithms:** Computes current conditions from noisy data.
- **Drift Correction Mechanisms:** Adjusts the model when deviations occur.
- **Calibration Procedures:** Periodic recalibration using historical and real-time comparisons.

## 4. Simulation Components

### 4.1 Environmental Simulation

The environmental simulator models the greenhouse conditions dynamically:

```typescript
export class EnvironmentalSimulator {
  private temperatureModel: any;
  private humidityModel: any;
  private co2Model: any;
  private lightModel: any;

  constructor() {
    this.temperatureModel = null;
    this.humidityModel = null;
    this.co2Model = null;
    this.lightModel = null;
  }

  public simulateStep(currentState: any, actions: any): void {
    /**
     * Simulate one time-step given the current state and control actions.
     */
    // Simulation calculations go here
    pass
  }

  public applyExternalConditions(weatherData: any): void {
    /**
     * Adjust simulation parameters based on external weather data.
     */
    // External condition application logic here
    pass
  }
}
```

### 4.2 Control System Simulation

The control simulation component mimics the behavior of the actuators and sensors under control algorithms:

```typescript
export class ControlSimulator {
  private actuatorModels: Map<string, any>;
  private sensorModels: Map<string, any>;
  private controlAlgorithms: Map<string, any>;

  constructor() {
    this.actuatorModels = new Map();
    this.sensorModels = new Map();
    this.controlAlgorithms = new Map();
  }

  public executeControlCycle(): void {
    /**
     * Run a full cycle of control decision execution and feedback.
     */
    // Control cycle logic goes here
    pass
  }

  public evaluatePerformance(): any {
    /**
     * Assess the effectiveness and response of the control loop.
     */
    // Performance evaluation logic goes here
    return null;
  }
}
```

## 5. Integration with Real System

### 5.1 Data Flow

The integration process merges live data with simulation outputs. The data flow is defined as:

```
[Real Sensors] → [Data Collection] → [State Estimation]
         ↓                            ↓                      ↓
 [Digital Twin] ← [State Synchronization] ← [Simulation Engine]
```

### 5.2 Synchronization Protocol

The protocol below outlines how the digital twin synchronizes with live data:

```json
{
  "sync_message": {
    "timestamp": "ISO8601",
    "real_state": {
      "sensors": { "data": "object" },
      "actuators": { "data": "object" }
    },
    "simulated_state": {
      "predicted": { "data": "object" },
      "actual": { "data": "object" }
    }
  }
