## 8. Code Examples

The following TypeScript examples illustrate how decision log records might be represented in code. These examples are designed to be executed with [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

### 8.1 Defining a Decision Record Interface

```typescript
// decision.ts

export interface DecisionRecord {
  id: string;
  date: string; // ISO8601 date string
  context: string;
  decision: string;
  alternatives: string[];
  consequences: {
    pros: string[];
    cons: string[];
  };
  status: 'Proposed' | 'Under Review' | 'Approved' | 'Deprecated' | 'Superseded';
}

// Example decision record for control system architecture
export const controlSystemDecision: DecisionRecord = {
  id: 'AD-001',
  date: new Date().toISOString(),
  context: `Requirement for a proactive greenhouse control mechanism.
            Compatibility with current greenhouse infrastructure.
            Need for real-time data processing.`,
  decision: 'Adopt a hybrid architecture that leverages both edge computing and cloud processing.',
  alternatives: [
    'Fully cloud-based system',
    'Fully local processing',
    'Hybrid approach'
  ],
  consequences: {
    pros: [
      'Lower latency for critical operations',
      'Enhanced fault tolerance'
    ],
    cons: [
      'Increased deployment complexity',
      'Higher initial setup costs'
    ]
  },
  status: 'Approved'
};
```

### 8.2 Logging a Decision

```typescript
// logDecision.ts

import { controlSystemDecision, DecisionRecord } from './decision';

export function logDecision(decision: DecisionRecord): void {
  console.log('--- Decision Log Entry ---');
  console.log(`ID: ${decision.id}`);
  console.log(`Date: ${decision.date}`);
  console.log(`Context: ${decision.context}`);
  console.log(`Decision: ${decision.decision}`);
  console.log(`Alternatives: ${decision.alternatives.join(', ')}`);
  console.log('Consequences:');
  console.log(`  Pros: ${decision.consequences.pros.join(', ')}`);
  console.log(`  Cons: ${decision.consequences.cons.join(', ')}`);
  console.log(`Status: ${decision.status}`);
}

// Execute the log using Bun
logDecision(controlSystemDecision);
```

To run these examples with Bun, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
bun run logDecision.ts
```
