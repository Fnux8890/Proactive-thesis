# Considerations for Using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Synthetic Sensor Data Generation

This document outlines the potential application, benefits, challenges, and recommendations for using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic time-series sensor data for the greenhouse simulation and optimization project.

## 1. Potential Benefits

Using GANs to generate synthetic sensor data could offer several advantages:

* **Data Augmentation:** For periods or specific sensor combinations where historical data is sparse or missing (as identified by data availability analysis), GANs could learn underlying patterns and generate additional realistic data points. This can lead to more robust training datasets for downstream models like LSTMs.
* **Enhanced Imputation:** As an advanced alternative to traditional imputation methods, GANs (particularly those designed for time-series) could fill missing data segments in a more contextually aware manner, potentially preserving complex inter-sensor correlations and temporal dynamics better.
* **Simulating Novel or Rare Scenarios:** If well-trained, GANs might be able to generate plausible data for scenarios that are infrequent in the historical dataset but are important for testing model robustness or exploring "what-if" conditions (e.g., unusual combinations of weather and internal setpoints).
* **Stress-Testing Models:** Synthetic data that is slightly "out-of-distribution" but still plausible can be generated to test the generalization and robustness of predictive models (e.g., the LSTM-based surrogate model).
* **Understanding Data Distribution:** The process of training a GAN can itself lead to a deeper understanding of the underlying joint probability distribution of the sensor data.

## 2. Challenges and Considerations

Despite the potential, GANs present significant challenges, especially for time-series data:

* **Complexity:** Designing, training, and tuning GANs (e.g., TimeGAN, Recurrent GANs) is considerably more complex than traditional data processing techniques. It requires specialized expertise in deep learning.
* **Training Stability & Mode Collapse:** GAN training can be unstable. A common issue is "mode collapse," where the generator produces only a limited variety of samples, failing to capture the full diversity of the real sensor data patterns.
* **Evaluation Difficulties:** Quantitatively assessing the "quality" or "realism" of synthetic time-series data is non-trivial. Standard GAN metrics from image generation do not directly apply. Evaluation would rely on:
  * Statistical comparisons (e.g., distributions, auto-correlations, cross-correlations between real and synthetic data).
  * Qualitative assessment by domain experts.
  * Performance of downstream models trained with/on the synthetic data.
* **Maintaining Temporal Dynamics:** Accurately capturing long-range temporal dependencies, seasonality, and auto-correlations in sensor data is a primary challenge. Standard GANs are not inherently suited for this, requiring specialized architectures.
* **Causality:** GANs excel at learning correlations but not necessarily causal relationships. Synthetic data might reflect spurious correlations present in the training set or fail to capture true causal links (e.g., actuator change leading to environmental change) unless the model is specifically designed to address this.
* **Data Requirements for GAN Training:** GANs still require a sufficient amount of high-quality, representative real data to learn from. If the original dataset is heavily biased or missing critical operational regimes, the GAN will likely learn and replicate these limitations.
* **Computational Cost:** Training GANs, especially for multivariate, high-frequency time-series data, can be computationally expensive, often requiring significant GPU resources and time.

## 3. Recommendations for this Project

Given the current stage of the project (focus on establishing robust data cleaning, imputation, and feature engineering pipelines), the use of GANs should be considered an **advanced, future exploration** rather than an immediate priority.

1. **Prioritize Foundational Data Processing:** First, ensure the main data pipeline in `src/` is robustly implemented:
    * Accurate data loading and type conversion.
    * Effective outlier detection and handling based on the insights from analytical scripts.
    * Appropriate imputation strategies to handle missing values, informed by data availability analysis.
    * Comprehensive feature engineering (`feature_calculator.py`, `feature_engineering.py`).
2. **Establish Baseline Model Performance:** Develop and evaluate the LSTM-based surrogate model using features derived from the well-processed real data. This provides a baseline against which any improvements from synthetic data can be measured.
3. **Clearly Define the Need for Synthetic Data:** If, after establishing a baseline, specific limitations are identified that synthetic data could address (e.g., persistent underrepresentation of critical scenarios, inability to impute large gaps effectively), then the use case for GANs becomes clearer.
4. **If Proceeding with GANs (Later Phase):**
    * **Research Time-Series Specific GANs:** Focus on architectures like TimeGAN, RC-GAN, or similar models designed for sequential data.
    * **Start Small:** Experiment with a subset of key sensors or a shorter, well-understood time period first.
    * **Focus on Evaluation:** Develop a clear set of metrics (statistical, qualitative, downstream task performance) to assess the quality of the generated synthetic data.
    * **Iterate:** GAN development is often an iterative process of experimentation and refinement.
5. **Consider Simpler Augmentation First:** Before diving into GANs, explore simpler time-series augmentation techniques if the primary goal is to increase dataset size for specific, less complex scenarios.

## 4. Relation to Data Availability Analysis

The insights from the `data_availability.py` script (visualizing gaps and periods of consistent data for each sensor) are crucial:

* They help identify which sensors or time periods might benefit most from GAN-based augmentation or imputation.
* They provide a basis for selecting high-quality, contiguous segments of real data to train the GAN effectively.
* They highlight periods where GAN-generated data might be particularly useful for filling in, to create a more complete dataset for model training.

In conclusion, while GANs offer exciting possibilities for synthetic sensor data generation, their complexity warrants a phased approach. Building a strong data processing foundation and clearly identifying the specific problems synthetic data will solve are essential prerequisites.
