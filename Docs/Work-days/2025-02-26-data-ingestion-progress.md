# Data Ingestion Progress - Feb 26, 2025

## Current State

We've been working on enhancing the data ingestion pipeline for the Proactive Energy Thesis project. The primary focus has been on improving the Elixir ingestion service to handle various file formats robustly and ensure correct processing of data files.

## Updated Pipeline Architecture

The data ingestion pipeline has been revised to better reflect the comprehensive role of the Elixir component:

```
Raw Data Sources → Elixir Ingestion & Processing → Staging Tables → Python Processing → Timeseries Tables → Feature Extraction
```

The Elixir component now handles not just file ingestion, but also substantial initial processing:
- File watching and event generation
- Data production and streaming
- Type-specific processing for different formats
- Schema inference
- Data profiling
- Time series processing
- Validation
- Metadata enrichment
- Transformation
- Writing to TimescaleDB

This comprehensive processing in Elixir allows the Python components to focus on specialized, domain-specific transformations rather than basic data preparation.

## Components Investigated

1. **Elixir Ingestion Service**
   - Fixed issues with the CSV separator detection and handling
   - Added support for detecting and handling different JSON structures
   - Implemented a verification output mechanism for logging processing results
   - Fixed compilation errors in the custom NimbleCSV parser module
   - Addressed issues with the selector function in the processor pipeline

2. **Docker Configuration**
   - Updated Docker configuration to mount the verification directory
   - Configured the verification output directory in the application settings
   - Updated the Dockerfile to create necessary directories

3. **Infrastructure Components**
   - Successfully started TimescaleDB, Redis, pgAdmin
   - Started Apache Airflow services (webserver, scheduler)
   - Started support services (metadata-catalog, data_processing, feature_extraction, quality_monitor)

## Issues Encountered and Fixed

1. **CSV Parsing Issues**
   - We encountered issues with the custom NimbleCSV parsers for different delimiters
   - Resolved by creating a simplified CsvSeparators module that defaults to the standard parser
   - Future work should implement proper custom parsers when needed

2. **Pipeline Event Selection**
   - Fixed the selector function to properly match file types by handling both atom and string comparisons
   - This addresses a critical issue that was preventing the Elixir ingestion service from starting

3. **Verification Output**
   - Added a structured verification output mechanism to track processing results
   - Created a mounted volume to access these results from outside the container

## Next Steps

1. **Testing with Real Data**
   - Test the ingestion service with real-world data files (CSV, JSON, Excel)
   - Verify that delimiter detection works correctly for various CSV formats
   - Confirm that JSON structure detection and flattening functions properly

2. **Integration with Airflow DAGs**
   - Ensure the Elixir ingestion DAG handles all files correctly
   - Test the coordination between the Elixir service and subsequent processing steps

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Identify and address any performance bottlenecks in the ingestion process
   - Consider batch processing options for large file sets

4. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Enhance error tracking and reporting in the verification output
   - Add automated recovery mechanisms for common failure scenarios

5. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update README and code documentation with the latest changes
   - Document best practices for adding new file formats or data sources

## Additional Considerations

As the project progresses, we should consider:

1. Adding support for more file formats (XML, Parquet, etc.)
2. Implementing more sophisticated data validation rules
3. Developing a monitoring dashboard for the ingestion pipeline
4. Setting up alerting for failed ingestion tasks
