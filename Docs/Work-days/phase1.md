### Work Log and Milestones

- Project kickoff and initial planning:  
  - Established the repository structure and defined key components (e.g., Excel to CSV conversion script).

- Development of the conversion script:  
  - Created xls_to_csv.py to transform legacy XLS files to CSV with robust error handling and detailed logging.

- Integration into the data ingestion pipeline:  
  - Began integrating the file conversion functionality into the Airflow DAG for dynamic file detection and processing.

- Documentation updates:  
  - Reviewed and refined the synthetic data generation research documentation.
  - Evaluated potential enhancements to Docker and environment configurations to support new processing tasks.

- Ongoing improvements:  
  - Further refined error handling and logging mechanisms across scripts.
  - Organized tasks and defined priorities for enhancing file processing logic and pipeline scalability.

- Future planning:  
  - Updated overall progress in phase1.md.
  - Outlined plans for phase 2 with a focus on integration testing and expanding dynamic file type detection in the Airflow DAG.
