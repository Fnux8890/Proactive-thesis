Elixir Ingestion Pipeline with Redis-Based Fault Tolerance
Architecture Overview
We've designed a robust data ingestion pipeline using Elixir's GenStage for efficient back-pressure-controlled processing with Redis as a fault tolerance mechanism. The architecture follows a hybrid approach that prioritizes performance while ensuring reliability.

Core Components
FileWatcher: Monitors directories for new files
Producer: Generates events from file notifications
Type-Specific Processor: Handles different data formats
SchemaInference: Determines data structure
DataProfiler: Analyzes data characteristics
Validator: Ensures data quality
MetadataEnricher: Augments data with context
Transformer: Converts to target format
Writer: Persists to TimeScaleDB
Redis Integration Strategy
Rather than using Redis for all inter-stage communication, we've opted for a hybrid approach:

Direct Processing Path: Under normal circumstances, data flows directly between GenStage components
Redis Fallback Path: When errors occur, data is checkpointed to Redis
Recovery Mechanism: Failed stages retry processing from Redis checkpoints
This approach provides:

Optimal performance during normal operation
Reliable fault tolerance for error conditions
Clean recovery from process or node failures
Project Organization
The supporting components are organized in a structured directory hierarchy:

├── pipeline/           # Core pipeline components
├── redis/              # Redis connection management

Fault Tolerance Mechanisms
Error Wrapping: Stage processing is wrapped in error handlers
Checkpointing: Critical data points are saved to Redis during failures
Unique Identifiers: Files are tracked through the pipeline
State Management: Processing status is maintained
Automatic Cleanup: Completed pipelines remove temporary data
Redis Configuration
Single Redis instance with multiple named queues
Connection pooling to minimize overhead
Combination of AOF (Append-Only File) and RDB (Redis Database) persistence
TTL settings to prevent orphaned data
Implementation Considerations
Error classification (retryable vs. terminal)
Rate limiting for retry operations
Metrics collection for monitoring
Atomic operations for state consistency
Cleanup processes for completed workflows
This architecture balances performance with reliability, enabling the pipeline to efficiently process large volumes of data while gracefully handling failures and ensuring no data is lost.
