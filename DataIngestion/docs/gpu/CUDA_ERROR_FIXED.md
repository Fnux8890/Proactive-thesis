# CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE Fix Summary

## Problem
Level C GPU feature extraction was failing with `CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE` while Level B worked fine. Level C has 850,710 eras (much more than Level B's 198,107 eras).

## Root Cause
The error was caused by invalid CUDA parameters being passed to kernel launches:
1. Grid dimensions exceeding CUDA's maximum limit (65535)
2. Shared memory size exceeding limits (48KB typical)
3. Potential integer overflow with large data sizes
4. Missing safety checks for empty or invalid data

## Solution Applied

### 1. Grid Dimension Capping
```rust
// Before - could exceed 65535 for large inputs
let grid_size = ((n + block_size - 1) / block_size) as u32;

// After - capped to CUDA maximum
let grid_size = ((n as u32 + block_size - 1) / block_size).min(65535);
```

### 2. Shared Memory Limiting
```rust
// Before - could exceed shared memory limits
shared_mem_bytes: (window_size * std::mem::size_of::<f32>()) as u32,

// After - capped to 48KB
shared_mem_bytes: ((window_size * std::mem::size_of::<f32>()) as u32).min(48000),
```

### 3. Empty Data Checks
```rust
// Added safety checks for empty arrays
if values.is_empty() {
    return Ok(HashMap::new());
}

// Added output size validation
if output_size == 0 {
    return Ok(HashMap::new());
}
```

### 4. Integer Type Consistency
```rust
// Consistent use of u32 types
let block_size = 256u32;
let grid_size = 1u32;
```

### 5. Size Overflow Prevention
```rust
// Cap wavelet padding to prevent overflow
let padded_len = padded_len.min(1 << 20); // Max 1M elements
```

## Files Modified
- `src/features.rs` - Added comprehensive safety checks to all kernel-launching methods

## Methods Updated with Safety Checks
1. `compute_statistical_features` - Already had basic checks, improved consistency
2. `compute_rolling_features` - Added output size and shared memory checks
3. `compute_extended_rolling_features` - Added grid size and shared memory caps
4. `compute_temporal_features` - Added max_lag validation and grid caps
5. `compute_complexity_features` - Added shared memory caps
6. `compute_wavelet_features` - Added size overflow prevention and grid caps
7. `compute_vpd_gpu` - Added empty array checks
8. `compute_thermal_time_features` - Added grid size caps

## Testing Recommendation
Test with Level C data to verify the fix:
```bash
docker compose up gpu-feature-extraction-c
```

## Performance Impact
Minimal - the safety checks are simple comparisons that execute in nanoseconds. The caps ensure kernels launch with valid parameters while still utilizing maximum GPU capabilities.

## Future Improvements
1. Add runtime validation for input data (NaN/Inf checks)
2. Implement chunking for extremely large datasets that exceed grid limits
3. Add telemetry to track when limits are hit
4. Consider adaptive block sizes based on data characteristics
