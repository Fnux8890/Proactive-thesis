# Extended GPU Algorithm Implementation

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Enhanced Shared Memory Usage (1.3 KB instead of 96 bytes)

The algorithm now uses ~1.3 KB of shared memory to compute:
- **Basic statistics**: mean, std, min, max
- **Higher moments**: skewness, kurtosis  
- **Percentiles**: q25, q50 (median), q75 using histogram
- **Position tracking**: indices of min/max values
- **Derived metrics**: range, IQR, coefficient of variation
- **Information theory**: approximate entropy from histogram
- **Energy**: sum of squared values

### 2. Era Detection Parameters Fixed

Previous parameters created 1.1M+ eras. New conservative parameters:

| Parameter | Old | New | Effect |
|-----------|-----|-----|---------|
| `pelt-min-size` | 288 | **8640** | 30 days minimum (8640 * 5min) |
| `bocpd-lambda` | 50.0 | **1000.0** | Much less sensitive |
| `hmm-states` | 10 | **3** | Simple low/medium/high states |

Expected results:
- Level A: 5-20 major eras (seasonal/equipment changes)
- Level B: 20-100 operational eras
- Level C: 100-500 detailed eras

### 3. Implementation Files

#### Created: `gpu_feature_extraction/src/kernels/statistics_enhanced.cu`
- Full CUDA kernel implementation with extended features
- Uses histogram-based percentile calculation
- Computes all statistics in a single pass
- Includes cross-correlation kernel for sensor relationships

#### Modified: `gpu_feature_extraction/src/features.rs`
```rust
// Enhanced shared memory allocation
let warp_stats_size = 44u32; // Extended WarpStats struct
let warp_shared_size = num_warps * warp_stats_size; // 352 bytes
let histogram_size = 256u32 * 4; // 1024 bytes for percentiles
let shared_mem_bytes = warp_shared_size + histogram_size; // 1376 bytes total
```

## Performance Benefits

### Memory Efficiency
- **Before**: 0.1% of available shared memory
- **After**: 1.4% of available shared memory
- **Headroom**: Still 98.6% available for future enhancements

### Computational Efficiency
- **Single-pass computation**: All statistics computed together
- **Warp-level parallelism**: Efficient reductions
- **Histogram reuse**: Percentiles and entropy from same data structure
- **Memory coalescing**: Sequential access patterns

### Feature Richness
From 6 features to 16+ features per sensor:
1. mean, std, min, max (original)
2. skewness, kurtosis (higher moments)
3. q25, q50, q75 (robustness)
4. range, IQR (spread measures)
5. CV (normalized variability)
6. energy (signal power)
7. entropy (complexity)
8. min_idx, max_idx (temporal info)

## Testing the Enhanced Implementation

### 1. Clean and Rebuild
```bash
# Clean previous results
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -c "
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS era_labels_level_a, era_labels_level_b, era_labels_level_c CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS gpu_features_level_a, gpu_features_level_b, gpu_features_level_c CASCADE;"

# Rebuild with enhanced kernel
docker compose build gpu_feature_extraction
```

### 2. Re-run Era Detection
```bash
docker compose up era_detector
```

### 3. Verify Era Counts
```bash
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -c "
SELECT 'Level A' as level, COUNT(*) as eras, 
       AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (end_time - start_time))/86400) as avg_days
FROM era_labels_level_a
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Level B', COUNT(*), AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (end_time - start_time))/86400)
FROM era_labels_level_b
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Level C', COUNT(*), AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (end_time - start_time))/86400)
FROM era_labels_level_c;"
```

### 4. Run Enhanced GPU Feature Extraction
```bash
docker compose up gpu_feature_extraction_level_a
```

## Future Enhancements (Using Remaining 98KB)

### 1. Sliding Window Cache (20-30 KB)
- Cache recent values for temporal features
- Compute autocorrelation at multiple lags
- Detect trends and changepoints

### 2. FFT Workspace (32-48 KB)
- Frequency domain analysis
- Power spectral density
- Dominant frequencies

### 3. Multi-Scale Statistics (10-20 KB)
- Compute features at hourly, daily, weekly scales
- Hierarchical temporal patterns
- Multi-resolution analysis

### 4. Advanced Percentiles (5-10 KB)
- More percentile points (p1, p5, p10, p90, p95, p99)
- Better histogram resolution (1024 bins)
- Kernel density estimation

## Integration with Existing Pipeline

The enhanced kernel is backward compatible:
- Same function signatures
- Additional features added to output
- Existing code continues to work
- New features available for advanced models

To use enhanced features in model training:
```python
# The GPU features table will now contain extended statistics
features_df = pd.read_sql("""
    SELECT era_id, features->>'mean' as mean,
           features->>'std' as std,
           features->>'skewness' as skewness,
           features->>'kurtosis' as kurtosis,
           features->>'q25' as q25,
           features->>'q50' as median,
           features->>'q75' as q75,
           features->>'entropy' as entropy
    FROM gpu_features_level_a
""", conn)
```
