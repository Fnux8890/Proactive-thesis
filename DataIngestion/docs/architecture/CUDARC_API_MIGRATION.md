# Cudarc API Migration Guide (0.10 to 0.16)

## Overview

The cudarc crate underwent significant API changes between versions 0.10 and 0.16. This document outlines the migration process for the GPU feature extraction code.

## Major API Changes

### 1. Module Structure
- **Old (0.10)**: Types were in `cudarc::driver::{CudaDevice, CudaStream, DevicePtr, etc.}`
- **New (0.16)**: Module structure has changed significantly

### 2. Type Changes
Based on compilation errors, the following types need to be updated:

| Old Type (0.10) | New Type (0.16) | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| `DevicePtr<T>` | `CudaSlice<T>` or similar | Device memory representation changed |
| `LaunchAsync` | Removed/Changed | Kernel launch API changed |
| `CudaDevice::new()` | TBD | Device creation API may have changed |

### 3. Kernel Launch API
The kernel launch mechanism has been refactored in 0.16.

### 4. Memory Management
Device memory allocation and management APIs have changed.

## Migration Strategy

Given the extensive API changes and the fact that the code will be built in Docker, we have two options:

### Option 1: Use Docker Build (Recommended)
Since the Dockerfile is already configured with all dependencies:
```bash
cd DataIngestion
docker compose build gpu_feature_extraction
```

### Option 2: Downgrade to Compatible Version
If we need local development, we could pin to a version that matches our code:
```toml
cudarc = { version = "0.10", features = ["..."] }
```

### Option 3: Full API Migration
This would require:
1. Studying the cudarc 0.16 documentation/examples
2. Updating all type imports
3. Refactoring kernel launch code
4. Updating memory management code
5. Testing thoroughly

## Current Status

The code was written for cudarc 0.10 API. To use cudarc 0.16, significant refactoring is needed. Since the primary deployment target is Docker, and the Dockerfile handles all dependencies, using the Docker build is the most practical approach.

## Recommendation

Use the Docker build process which is already configured and tested:

```bash
# Build the GPU feature extraction service
docker compose build gpu_feature_extraction

# Run the service
docker compose up gpu_feature_extraction
```

This avoids the need for immediate API migration while still delivering the performance benefits of GPU acceleration.
