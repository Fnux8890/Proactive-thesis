# Parallel Feature Extraction Optimization Summary

## Code Quality Improvements

All parallel processing code has been refactored following Python best practices:

1. **Import Organization**: Sorted and grouped imports
2. **Type Hints**: Added comprehensive type annotations
3. **Docstrings**: Detailed documentation for all classes and methods
4. **Code Formatting**: Consistent style following PEP 8
5. **Error Handling**: Improved exception handling and logging

## Smart Task Distribution

Based on analysis of the feature extraction pipeline, we've implemented intelligent work distribution:

### Sensor Classification

**GPU-Suitable Sensors** (high-frequency, continuous):
- `air_temp_c`, `relative_humidity_percent`, `light_intensity_umol`
- `radiation_w_m2`, `co2_measured_ppm`, `pipe_temp_1_c`
- `flow_temp_1_c`, `outside_temp_c`

**CPU-Suitable Sensors** (binary/categorical, complex calculations):
- `rain_status`, `co2_status`, `co2_dosing_status`
- `spot_price_dkk_mwh` (low-frequency)
- Ventilation position sensors (complex logic)

**Efficient Profile Sensors** (more statistical features):
- `air_temp_c`, `relative_humidity_percent`, `co2_measured_ppm`
- `light_intensity_umol`, `radiation_w_m2`, `dli_sum`, `par_synth_umol`

### Smart Coordinator Features

The `SmartFeatureCoordinator` analyzes each era before distribution:

1. **Era Analysis**: 
   - Queries sensor composition
   - Calculates GPU-suitable ratio
   - Computes complexity score
   - Estimates data volume

2. **Distribution Logic**:
   ```python
   if total_readings < 10,000:
       → CPU (overhead not worth it)
   elif total_readings > 500,000:
       → GPU (large volume benefits)
   elif gpu_suitable_ratio > 0.6:
       → GPU (sensor types match)
   elif complexity_score > 0.5:
       → GPU (complex features benefit)
   else:
       → CPU
   ```

3. **Load Balancing**: 
   - Bin packing algorithm
   - Considers actual data volume
   - Even distribution across workers

## Performance Optimizations

### GPU Worker Enhancements

1. **Selective Rolling Statistics**: Only computed for GPU-suitable sensors
2. **Adaptive Window Sizes**: Based on sampling frequency (5-min intervals)
3. **Profile-Based Extraction**: 
   - Efficient profile for key sensors
   - Minimal profile for others
4. **Memory Management**: 30GB GPU memory pool with explicit cleanup

### CPU Worker Optimizations

1. **Parallel tsfresh**: 4 jobs per worker
2. **Variance-based Feature Selection**: Remove low-variance features
3. **Efficient Data Transformation**: Optimized long format conversion

## Expected Performance Gains

With smart distribution on A2 instance (4x A100, 48 vCPUs):

| Era Type | Old Method | Smart Distribution | Speedup |
|----------|------------|-------------------|---------|
| Large (>1M rows) | 60-120 min | 5-10 min | 10-12x |
| Medium (100K-1M) | 20-40 min | 3-5 min | 6-8x |
| Small (<100K) | 5-10 min | 1-2 min | 4-5x |

**Overall Pipeline**: ~2-4 hours (vs 20-40 hours single-threaded)

## Resource Utilization

- **GPU Utilization**: Target >80% for large eras
- **CPU Utilization**: 70-80% across all workers
- **Memory Usage**: Adaptive based on era size
- **Database Connections**: Pooled via PgBouncer (max 200)

## Deployment

Use either coordinator based on needs:

```bash
# Smart distribution (recommended)
export USE_SMART_DISTRIBUTION=true
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.parallel-feature.yml up

# Simple size-based distribution
export USE_SMART_DISTRIBUTION=false
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.parallel-feature.yml up
```

## Monitoring

Key metrics to track:
- Era distribution (GPU vs CPU)
- Processing time per era
- Worker load balance
- Memory usage per worker
- Feature extraction success rate
