# Model Builder Fix Summary

## Problem
The `model_builder` service was failing to build due to:
1. Missing `make` utility in the conda environment
2. Attempting to build LightGBM from source with GPU support, but OpenCL was not available
3. Complex entrypoint script causing permission issues

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added `make` to conda install
```dockerfile
RUN mamba install -y -c conda-forge \
    cmake \
    make \    # <-- Added this
    boost \
    boost-cpp \
    compilers \
    git \
    && mamba clean -afy
```

### 2. Replaced source build with pip install
Instead of building LightGBM from source:
```dockerfile
# OLD - Failed due to missing OpenCL
RUN git clone --recursive --branch stable --depth 1 https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM.git /tmp/LightGBM \
    && cd /tmp/LightGBM \
    && mkdir build && cd build \
    && cmake -DUSE_GPU=1 -DUSE_CUDA=1 -DCUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/cuda .. \
    && make -j$(nproc) \
    ...
```

Now using:
```dockerfile
# NEW - Simple pip install
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir lightgbm==4.*
```

### 3. Removed complex entrypoint
Simplified the Dockerfile by removing the GPU check entrypoint that was causing permission issues.

## Result
âœ… **model_builder service now builds successfully!**

## GPU Acceleration Options

While the standard LightGBM doesn't have GPU support in this configuration, you have these options:

1. **Use XGBoost with GPU** - Already available in RAPIDS base image
2. **Use cuML algorithms** - GPU-accelerated ML algorithms from RAPIDS
3. **Use the CPU version of LightGBM** - Often fast enough for many use cases
4. **Consider using the GPU-optimized dockerfile** - See `dockerfile.gpu-optimized`

## Testing the Fixed Service

```bash
# Build
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml build model_builder

# Test
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml run --rm model_builder python -c "
import lightgbm as lgb
import torch
print(f'LightGBM version: {lgb.__version__}')
print(f'PyTorch version: {torch.__version__}')
print(f'CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')
print('Model builder is ready!')
"
```

## Cloud Deployment Status
With this fix, all services should now build successfully for cloud deployment!
