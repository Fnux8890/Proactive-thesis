# ðŸ§¹ Workspace Cleanup Summary

## Current Situation
- **24 files** (docker-compose*.yml, *.sh, *.ps1) cluttering the DataIngestion directory
- Many are old, unused, or replaced by newer implementations

## Files to REMOVE (14 files)

### Unused Docker Compose Files (4)
- `docker-compose.override.yml` - Local dev override, not needed
- `docker-compose.cloud.yml` - Old cloud config, replaced by prod.yml
- `docker-compose.parallel-feature.yml` - Not used anywhere
- `docker-compose.production.yml` - Gets created dynamically by terraform

### Old/Unused Scripts (10)
- `docker-flow-deploy.sh` - Old deployment method
- `preflight_check.sh` - Not integrated into current workflow  
- `run_flow.sh` - Old flow runner
- `run_model_builder_gpu_test.sh` - Specific test, obsolete
- `run_moea_comparison.sh` - One-off comparison
- `run_orchestrated.sh` - Replaced by run_production_pipeline.sh
- `run_orchestration.ps1` - PowerShell version, not needed
- `run_parallel_feature_extraction.sh` - Old parallel approach
- `run_pipeline_with_validation.ps1` - Old validation
- `run_pipeline_with_validation.sh` - Old validation

## Files to KEEP (10 files)

### Essential Docker Compose (2)
- âœ… `docker-compose.yml` - Base configuration
- âœ… `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Cloud production overrides

### Production Scripts (1)
- âœ… `run_production_pipeline.sh` - Used by Terraform in cloud

### Testing Scripts (6)
- âœ… `test_all_services.sh` - Comprehensive service testing
- âœ… `test_cloud_compose.sh` - Cloud configuration testing
- âœ… `test_minimal_pipeline.sh` - Quick validation with minimal data
- âœ… `test_services_runtime.sh` - Runtime testing with data flow
- âœ… `validate_services.sh` - Configuration validation
- âœ… `run_tests.sh` - Test runner (if it exists)

### Utility Scripts (1)
- âœ… `cleanup_unused_files.sh` - This cleanup script

## How to Clean Up

```bash
# Run the cleanup script
./cleanup_unused_files.sh

# It will:
# 1. Show all files that will be removed
# 2. Ask for confirmation
# 3. Remove only the unused files
# 4. Show what remains
```

## After Cleanup

You'll have a clean workspace with only:
- 2 docker-compose files (base + cloud)
- 1 production script (for cloud deployment)
- 6 testing scripts (for validation)
- Clear, organized structure

## Benefits
- âœ… No confusion about which docker-compose to use
- âœ… Clear separation between testing and production
- âœ… Easier to maintain and understand
- âœ… Reduced chance of using wrong scripts
- âœ… Clean git status
