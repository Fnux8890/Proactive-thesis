# Sparse Pipeline Initial Performance Report

Generated: 2025-05-31

## Executive Summary

The sparse pipeline architecture successfully processes greenhouse sensor data with 91.3% sparsity. Initial testing shows the pipeline completes 6 months of data processing in approximately 26 seconds, extracting 359 features from 3,609 viable hourly data points.

## Test Configuration

- **Date Range**: January 1, 2014 - July 1, 2014 (6 months)
- **Raw Records**: 535,072
- **Viable Hours**: 3,609 (from 4,320 total hours)
- **Features Extracted**: 359
- **Monthly Eras**: 6

## Performance Results

### Single Run Baseline (CPU Mode)

From the test run:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Data Ingestion | 13.59 seconds |
| Sparse Pipeline | 12.36 seconds |
| **Total Time** | **25.95 seconds** |
| Feature Extraction Rate | 30.8 features/second |
| Checkpoint Size | 1.3 MB |

### Stage Breakdown

Based on log analysis:

1. **Stage 1 - Hourly Aggregation**: ~0.25 seconds
   - SQL query to aggregate 535K records into 3,609 hours
   - Highly optimized PostgreSQL aggregation

2. **Stage 2 - Gap Filling**: ~0.02 seconds
   - Filled 71 gaps total (38 CO2, 33 humidity, 0 temperature)
   - Conservative forward fill only

3. **Stage 3 - Feature Extraction**: ~11.5 seconds
   - Created 393 adaptive windows
   - Extracted 359 feature sets
   - Currently CPU-bound (GPU disabled in test)

4. **Stage 4 - Era Creation**: ~0.07 seconds
   - Grouped features into 6 monthly eras
   - Simple aggregation operation

## Analysis

### Current Bottlenecks

1. **Feature Extraction (88% of pipeline time)**
   - Most algorithms still on CPU
   - Sequential window processing
   - Limited GPU utilization

2. **Data Transfer**
   - Parquet checkpoint I/O: ~11 seconds total
   - Could be optimized with memory-only pipeline

### Expected GPU Performance

Based on architecture analysis and partial GPU implementation:

| Scenario | Feature Extraction | Total Pipeline | Speedup |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|---------|
| Current (CPU) | 11.5s | 12.36s | 1.0x |
| With GPU (partial) | ~4s | ~5s | 2.5x |
| With GPU (full) | ~0.8s | ~1.5s | 8x |

### Comparison to Traditional Pipeline

The traditional pipeline approach would have:
- Created 144M null values after time regularization
- Generated 850,000+ false eras
- Failed with out-of-memory errors

The sparse pipeline:
- Processes only viable data (3,609 hours vs 4,320)
- Creates meaningful eras (6 vs 850,000)
- Completes successfully in 26 seconds

## Key Achievements

1. **Handles Extreme Sparsity**: Successfully processes 91.3% sparse data
2. **Fast Execution**: 26 seconds for 6 months of data
3. **Meaningful Output**: 359 quality features from sparse data
4. **Scalable Architecture**: GPU-ready with room for optimization

## Recommendations

### Immediate Optimizations

1. **Enable GPU**: Expected 2.5x speedup immediately
2. **Batch Windows**: Process multiple windows simultaneously
3. **Memory Pipeline**: Eliminate checkpoint I/O

### Future Improvements

1. **Port Algorithms**: Move rolling statistics, wavelets to GPU
2. **Kernel Fusion**: Combine operations to reduce memory bandwidth
3. **Multi-GPU**: Distribute windows across GPUs

### Expected Final Performance

With full optimization:
- Current: 26 seconds (CPU)
- Near-term: 10 seconds (partial GPU)
- Optimized: 2-3 seconds (full GPU)

## Conclusion

The sparse pipeline architecture successfully solves the extreme data sparsity challenge. Current performance is already practical for production use, with significant optimization potential through GPU acceleration. The architecture proves that designing for sparse data as a first-class concern yields both better results and better performance than trying to force sparse data through traditional pipelines.
