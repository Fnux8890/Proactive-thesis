## Key Innovation

This implementation specifically addresses the 91.3% sparsity challenge by:
- Never assuming continuous data
- Computing features only where data exists
- Providing coverage metrics for result confidence
- Using event-based features that work with gaps
- Implementing domain-specific sparse-aware metrics

The hybrid Rust+Python approach leverages:
- Rust's performance for basic statistics and logic
- Python's GPU libraries for complex computations
- Parallel processing for multi-sensor scenarios
- Graceful degradation when GPU unavailable

This sparse feature extraction system enables the MOEA to work effectively with real-world greenhouse data despite extreme sparsity.
