1. Airflow DAG (airflow_dags/data_ingestion_dag.py)
──────────────────────────────
• Purpose:  
  – Orchestrate the entire workflow from raw data ingestion to post-processing verification.
• What to update/create:  

- Add (or update) tasks in the DAG to:
    • Check for new raw data.
    • Trigger a data loading task (which will load files into a staging area).
    • Verify that staging succeeded (for example, check that tables in the “staging” schema have “new” records).
    • Trigger a data processing task that calls a cleaning/transformation script.
    • Perform a final verification to ensure that processed (clean) data landed in TimescaleDB.
- Use TaskGroups or separate operators if you want to split file type processing (CSV vs. JSON) dynamically.
  
──────────────────────────────
2. Data Loader Script (data_processing/data_loader.py)
──────────────────────────────
• Purpose:  
  – Scan a configured input directory (mounted from your host) and load files into a staging area in TimescaleDB.
• What to update/create:  

- Ensure dynamic file detection based on file extensions (handle CSV and JSON; ignore ZIP files).
- Introduce conditional logic so that—for example:
    • For CSV files, try using delimiter inference and robust error handling (as you have with on_bad_lines='warn').
    • For JSON files, use pd.read_json and convert if necessary.
- Populate a staging table in a dedicated "staging" schema; add metadata columns (timestamp, source file, status).
- Log success or failure for each file.
  
──────────────────────────────
3. Data Processing / Transformation Script (data_processing/process_data.py)
──────────────────────────────
• Purpose:  
  – Take the staged raw data and apply deeper validation, cleanup, and transformation before final loading.
• What to update/create:  

- Enhance the existing script to include common cleanup steps (e.g., trim whitespace, fix column types, date formatting).
- Add file-specific corrections – for instance, if a file from knudjepsen shows mismatches in field counts, add logic to correct or flag those discrepancies.
- Load the cleaned (processed) data into final TimescaleDB production tables.
- Optionally, split this script into helper modules or functions if the processing logic grows complex.
  
──────────────────────────────
4. Docker Compose Configuration (docker-compose.yml)
──────────────────────────────
• Purpose:  
  – Define and run all services (TimescaleDB, Airflow components, pgAdmin for DB GUI, and data processing containers).
• What to update/create:  

- Ensure volumes are set up correctly to mount raw data folders.
- Confirm that network settings and environment variables (via .env) are properly configured.
- (Optional) If you plan to separate ingestion and processing into different containers eventually, define additional services.
- You already have pgAdmin added for visual database management.
  
──────────────────────────────
5. Environment File (.env)
──────────────────────────────
• Purpose:  
  – Store configuration parameters required by Docker Compose and the Airflow services.
• What to update/create:  

- Verify that all environment variables for Airflow initialization and TimescaleDB connections are set (e.g., AIRFLOW__DATABASE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN, PROCESSING_DB_URL, DATA_INPUT_PATH).
- Include Airflow user creation variables so that the first-time setup automatically creates the proper login.
  
──────────────────────────────
6. Documentation & Diagrams (README.md, ingestion_diagram.md)
──────────────────────────────
• Purpose:  
  – Document the architecture and how the pipeline functions.
• What to update/create:  

- Update README.md with the steps for building, starting, and troubleshooting the pipeline.
- Revise or annotate the ingestion_diagram.md to show the modified flow:
    • Raw data ingestion → Dynamic file-type detection → Staging in TimescaleDB → Processing and cleanup → Final load.
  
──────────────────────────────
7. Optional Enhancements
──────────────────────────────
• Conditional Processing:  

- If processing logic for different file types (aarslev vs. knudjepsen) becomes very different, consider splitting the processing into separate DAG tasks or even separate containers.
- You can reuse common functions by creating a separate module within `data_processing/` that the different scripts import.
  
• Error Handling & Notifications:  

- Incorporate logging and Airflow alerts so that when ingestion or processing fails, you're notified via logs or email.

Summary of Workflow
──────────────────────────────

- **Step 1:** Airflow triggers the DAG.
- **Step 2:** Raw data files (CSV/JSON/XLS) from the input mounted volume are read by the Data Loader script.  
  The Data Loader:
    • Dynamically detects file type.
    • Loads data into a staging schema in TimescaleDB along with metadata.
- **Step 3:** A verification task checks that the staging tables have the expected “new” records.
- **Step 4:** The Data Processing script is invoked to clean, transform, and validate the data based on file-specific rules.
- **Step 5:** Clean data is then inserted into final production tables in TimescaleDB.
- **Step 6:** A final verification task confirms the success of loading clean data.

This structured approach ensures that each part of the pipeline is modular, making it easier to update or scale later.

Would you like to see sample code snippets for any particular section (e.g., conditional file processing in the data loader, or splitting tasks in the DAG)?
