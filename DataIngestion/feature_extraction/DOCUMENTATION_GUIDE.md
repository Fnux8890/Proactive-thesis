# Feature Extraction Documentation Guide

## Component Documentation

Each component maintains its own README for specific implementation details:

- `feature_extraction/README.md` - Main feature extraction overview
- `feature_extraction/parallel/README.md` - Parallel processing implementation
- `feature_extraction/feature/README.md` - CPU feature extraction details
- `feature_extraction/pre_process/README.md` - Preprocessing pipeline
- `feature_extraction/benchmarks/README.md` - Performance benchmarks
- `feature_extraction/tests/README.md` - Testing documentation

## Centralized Documentation

Project-wide documentation has been moved to `/docs`:

- System Architecture → `/docs/architecture/`
- Database Documentation → `/docs/database/`
- Operational Guides → `/docs/operations/`
- Migration History → `/docs/migrations/`
- Deployment Guides → `/docs/deployment/`

## Preprocessing Reports

The preprocessing pipeline reports remain in:
`feature_extraction/pre_process/report_for_preprocess/`

These are component-specific technical reports that are actively used by the preprocessing module.
