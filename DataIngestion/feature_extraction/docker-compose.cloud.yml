# Docker Compose override for cloud deployment with high-performance settings
# This configuration is optimized for cloud instances with many cores and GPU
#
# Usage:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.feature.yml -f docker-compose.cloud.yml up --build
#
# Recommended cloud instances:
#   - AWS: p3.2xlarge (8 vCPUs, 61 GB RAM, 1 x NVIDIA V100)
#   - GCP: n1-highmem-8 with 1 x NVIDIA T4
#   - Azure: NC6s_v3 (6 vCPUs, 112 GB RAM, 1 x NVIDIA V100)
