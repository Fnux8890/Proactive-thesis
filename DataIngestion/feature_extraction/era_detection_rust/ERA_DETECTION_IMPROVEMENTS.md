# Era Detection Rust Code Improvements

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Removed Redundant Files ✅
- Deleted `src/db_hybrid_fixed.rs` - redundant backup file
- Deleted `fix_duplicate_key.patch` and `fix_era_detection.patch` - historical patches already integrated
- Deleted `DUPLICATE_KEY_FIX.md` - documentation for already-fixed issue
- Deleted `test_fix.sh` - test script for fixed issue

### 2. Fixed Compilation Warnings ✅
- Removed unused variable `_scale` in `quantize_signal_f64()` function
- Removed unused parameter `_num_iterations` from `viterbi_path_from_observations()` in level_c.rs
- Updated all call sites to match the new function signature

### 3. Enhanced Database Connection Pool ✅
- Increased max pool size from default 10 to 20 connections
- Added min idle connections (5) for better performance
- Added connection timeout (30s), max lifetime (30m), and idle timeout (10m)
- Added adaptive parallelism based on CPU count using `num_cpus` crate

### 4. Refactored Column Selection Logic ✅
- Created new module `column_selection.rs` with helper functions:
  - `validate_user_columns()` - validates user-specified columns
  - `select_optimal_signals()` - selects optimal signals meeting coverage threshold
  - `select_numeric_columns_by_coverage()` - selects numeric columns by coverage
  - `select_columns()` - main column selection logic
- Created new module `optimal_signals.rs` to define preferred signal groups
- Moved `coverage()` function to `io.rs` module for better organization

### 5. Improved JSON Parsing Error Handling ✅
- Added `parse_json_features()` helper function for robust JSON parsing
- Added detailed error logging with row numbers and content previews
- Tracks and reports total parsing errors
- Handles non-object JSON values gracefully
- Provides better error context for debugging

## Performance Improvements

1. **Connection Pool Optimization**: Better resource utilization with tuned pool settings
2. **Adaptive Parallelism**: Automatically adjusts thread count based on available CPUs
3. **Error Recovery**: Continues processing even when JSON parsing fails for some rows

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **Modularization**: Split complex logic into separate modules for better maintainability
2. **Error Handling**: More descriptive error messages with context
3. **Type Safety**: Fixed type mismatches and improved compile-time guarantees
4. **Documentation**: Added comprehensive doc comments for new functions

## Race Condition Analysis

The race condition in era label saving was already fixed in the current code using database transactions. The `save_era_labels()` method in `db_hybrid.rs` performs atomic DELETE + INSERT operations within a single transaction, preventing duplicate key violations when processing signals in parallel.

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

1. **Implement actual PELT algorithm**: Current "Level A" uses BOCPD but claims to be "PELT-like"
2. **Add prepared statements**: For repeated database queries to improve performance
3. **Implement streaming for large DataFrames**: To reduce memory usage
4. **Add more comprehensive unit tests**: Especially for the new modular components
5. **Consider using async/await**: For better resource utilization in I/O operations
