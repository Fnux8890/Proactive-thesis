# GPU Feature Extraction Bug Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. ✅ Rust Compilation Errors
**Problem**: Polars arithmetic operations failed with trait bound errors
```rust
error[E0277]: the trait bound `&ChunkedArray<Float32Type>: Num` is not satisfied
```

**Solution**: Fixed arithmetic operations in `sparse_pipeline.rs`:
```rust
// Before:
let overall_coverage = (&temp_coverage + &co2_coverage + &humidity_coverage) / 3.0;

// After:
let sum_coverage = (&temp_series + &co2_series)?;
let sum_coverage_final = (&sum_coverage + &humidity_series)?;
let overall_coverage = &sum_coverage_final / 3.0;
```

### 2. ✅ Coverage Calculation Bug
**Problem**: Coverage divided by 60 (minutes/hour) but sparse data only has 2-7 readings/hour

**Solution**: Changed divisor from 60 to 10 in `add_coverage_metrics()`:
```rust
let temp_coverage = temp_counts / 10.0;  // Was: / 60.0
```

### 3. ✅ Unused Variable Warnings
**Problem**: Multiple warnings about unused fields and methods

**Solution**: Prefixed unused fields with underscore:
- `ctx` → `_ctx` in `features.rs`
- `min_coverage_threshold` → `_min_coverage_threshold` in `data_quality.rs`

### 4. ✅ Test Structure Issues
**Problem**: Tests couldn't compile due to database dependency

**Solution**: Created simplified tests in `simple_tests.rs` that test core logic without database

### 5. ✅ Missing Polars Feature
**Problem**: `activate feature 'streaming'` panic when saving parquet

**Solution**: Added "streaming" feature to Cargo.toml:
```toml
polars = { version = "0.42", features = ["lazy", "parquet", "temporal", "strings", "chunked_ids", "streaming"] }
```

## Current Status

✅ **Compilation**: Code compiles successfully with only minor warnings
✅ **Tests**: 3 unit tests pass successfully
✅ **Python**: minimal_gpu_features.py is syntactically correct

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Docker Build**: The release build takes very long (>10 minutes). Need to use the optimized Dockerfile with cargo-chef for caching.

2. **Integration Testing**: Need to test with actual database connection and sparse data.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: Empty hours and all-NULL data need proper handling.

## How to Test

```bash
# Check compilation
cargo check

# Run tests
cargo test --lib simple_tests

# Build release (takes long time)
cargo build --release --bin gpu_feature_extraction
```

## Next Steps for Docker

Since the Docker build takes too long, you should:

1. Use the optimized Dockerfile:
```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.optimized -t gpu-sparse-fixed .
```

2. Or use the existing image with the database column fix:
```sql
ALTER TABLE sensor_data_merged 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS lamp_grp3_no4_status BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
```

The sparse pipeline is now ready for end-to-end testing once the Docker image is built.
