# Data Pipeline Architecture Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to the data pipeline architecture to address the issues identified in the refactoring plan. The primary goal was to establish a clear, sequential flow from data ingestion through to feature extraction, with TimescaleDB as the central source of truth.

## Key Architectural Changes

### 1. Established Clear Data Flow

The pipeline now follows a strict sequential flow:

```
Raw Data Sources → Ingestion → Staging Tables → Processing → Timeseries Tables → Feature Extraction
```

Each step has well-defined inputs and outputs, with no circular dependencies or bypassing of steps.

### 2. Single Source of Truth

TimescaleDB now serves as the canonical data store for all pipeline stages:

- **Staging Schema**: Holds raw data with minimal transformations
- **Timeseries Schema**: Contains cleaned, transformed, and normalized data
- **Features Schema**: Stores extracted features linked to timeseries data

All downstream processes (feature extraction, quality monitoring) now read exclusively from TimescaleDB rather than from raw files.

### 3. Clear Component Boundaries

Each component in the pipeline has a well-defined responsibility:

- **Elixir Ingestion Service**: File detection, validation, and triggering
- **Data Processing Service**: Data cleaning, transformation, and persistence
- **Feature Extraction Service**: Feature discovery, evaluation, and selection
- **Quality Monitoring Service**: Data quality assessment and anomaly detection

### 4. Comprehensive Metadata Tracking

The pipeline now tracks metadata at every stage:

- **Schema Registry**: Tracks schema versions and changes
- **Data Lineage**: Documents the flow of data through the pipeline
- **Processing Runs**: Records details about each processing run
- **Feature Extraction Runs**: Tracks feature extraction activities
- **Quality Monitoring Runs**: Logs quality assessment results

## Implemented Components

### 1. Database Migrations

Created migration scripts to establish the necessary database structure:

- `01_create_schemas.sql`: Base schema structure and extensions
- `02_create_staging_tables.sql`: Tables for raw data ingestion
- `03_create_timeseries_tables.sql`: TimescaleDB hypertables for processed data
- `04_create_feature_tables.sql`: Tables for storing extracted features

### 2. Airflow DAGs

Restructured the Airflow DAGs to reflect the correct flow:

#### Data Ingestion DAG (`data_ingestion_dag_revised.py`)

- Checks for new files via the Elixir API
- Loads data into staging tables
- Verifies data was loaded correctly
- Triggers the data processing DAG

#### Data Processing DAG (`data_processing_dag.py`)

- Processes data from staging to timeseries tables
- Applies transformations and cleaning
- Updates processing status
- Triggers feature extraction when appropriate

#### Feature Extraction DAG (`feature_extraction_dag_revised.py`)

- Reads exclusively from timeseries tables
- Extracts statistical, temporal, and domain-specific features
- Evaluates feature importance
- Creates feature sets for downstream use
- Marks timeseries data as processed for features

#### Quality Monitoring DAG (`quality_monitoring_dag_revised.py`)

- Assesses data quality in timeseries tables
- Detects anomalies in the data
- Generates quality reports
- Sends alerts for detected issues

## Benefits of the New Architecture

### 1. Improved Data Integrity

- Clear data lineage from source to features
- Consistent schema enforcement
- Quality monitoring at each stage

### 2. Enhanced Maintainability

- Modular components with clear responsibilities
- Well-defined interfaces between components
- Comprehensive metadata for debugging and auditing

### 3. Better Scalability

- Independent scaling of ingestion, processing, and feature extraction
- Efficient use of TimescaleDB for time series data
- Parallel processing where appropriate

### 4. Increased Reliability

- Robust error handling and reporting
- Clear status tracking for each pipeline stage
- Anomaly detection and alerting

## Next Steps

1. **Implementation of Processing Scripts**: Develop the Python scripts referenced in the DAGs for data loading, processing, and feature extraction.

2. **Integration Testing**: Test the end-to-end pipeline with sample data to ensure proper flow and data integrity.

3. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Create a dashboard for visualizing pipeline status, data quality metrics, and feature statistics.

4. **Documentation**: Complete detailed documentation for each component, including API references and operational procedures.

5. **Performance Optimization**: Analyze and optimize database queries, processing algorithms, and resource utilization.

## Conclusion

The refactored pipeline architecture provides a solid foundation for reliable data processing and feature extraction. By establishing TimescaleDB as the central source of truth and implementing clear boundaries between components, we have created a more maintainable, scalable, and robust system that will better support the MOGA optimization processes.
