# Preprocess Folder Code Review

This document summarizes the review and minor fixes applied to the scripts located in
`DataIngestion/feature_extraction/pre_process`.

## Summary of fixes
- Normalized the check for `DatetimeIndex` in `preprocess.py` when converting the
  index to datetime.
- Removed an unused SQL definition in `fetch_energy.py` and simplified table
  creation logic.
- Ensured all Python files in the folder end with a newline character which
  avoids accidental shell prompt concatenation when viewing files.

These adjustments improve readability and avoid potential parsing issues during
execution.
