**Optimizing plant growth & energy efficiency through proactive simulation, multi-objective optimization, and investigation of advanced computational acceleration.**

This project develops an advanced **data-driven climate control and optimization system** for greenhouses. It aims to enhance plant health and resource efficiency by integrating **proactive strategies**, **species-specific plant growth simulation** (initially focusing on *Kalanchoe blossfeldiana*), and **multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs)**. Building upon concepts from frameworks like DynaGrow, this work seeks to provide more tailored and computationally feasible solutions for sustainable greenhouse management.

### ðŸ”¬ **How It Works**
Leveraging historical data, predictive modeling, and (future) IoT-driven environmental adjustments, this system dynamically balances energy efficiency and plant growth. Key aspects include:

- **Data Pipeline & Feature Engineering**: Ingesting historical greenhouse data, performing preprocessing (including era detection based on techniques like PELT/BOCPD/HMM), and extracting features crucial for the subsequent simulation and optimization phases (FR-1, FR-2).
- **Species-Specific Plant Simulation**: Implementing and calibrating plant growth models (e.g., for Kalanchoe) to predict responses to various control strategies (FR-3, NFR-6.1). This is a core component for evaluating potential outcomes.
- **Multi-Objective Optimization (MOEA)**: Employing algorithms like NSGA-II to find Pareto-optimal control strategies that balance conflicting objectives, such as minimizing energy costs and maximizing simulated plant growth (FR-4).
- **Addressing Computational Bottlenecks**: A primary research focus is tackling the significant computational demands of detailed plant-specific simulations and extensive MOEA evaluations. This involves:
  - Identifying performance limitations on traditional CPU architectures.
  - **Investigating and implementing GPU acceleration using CUDA** for critical components (plant model simulation, MOEA fitness evaluations) across various GPU tiers (consumer, professional, data-center class).
- **Scalable, Modular Software Architecture**: Designing the system (primarily Python for simulation/optimization, potentially orchestrated with Elixir/Docker for broader pipeline elements) for extensibility and real-world integration (NFR-2, NFR-3, NFR-4).
