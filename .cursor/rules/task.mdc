# Rule: Project Task Management via tasks.md

## Context: Task Tracking File

This project uses a central task management file for the Rust component located at:

`DataIngestion/rust_pipeline/tasks.md`

This file (`DataIngestion/rust_pipeline/tasks.md`) outlines the project's overall structure via Reports and Story Points. It uses Markdown checkboxes to track progress:
- `[ ]` indicates an incomplete task.
- `[x]` indicates a completed task.

The file also identifies current priorities, often marked with **(NEXT PRIORITY)**, and provides a snapshot of the overall project status.

## AI Agent Directives

1.  **Mandatory Consultation:** **ALWAYS consult the `DataIngestion/rust_pipeline/tasks.md` file *before* starting any new implementation, planning the next steps, or generating significant code.** Use it to understand the current focus, what has been completed, and what the immediate next steps are.

2.  **Contextual Awareness:** Use the status (`[ ]` vs `[x]`) in `DataIngestion/rust_pipeline/tasks.md` to maintain context about the project's progress and dependencies.

3.  **Identifying Next Steps:** When asked for the next steps or proposing work, base your suggestions primarily on the first available incomplete task (`[ ]`), especially any marked with **(NEXT PRIORITY)**, listed in `DataIngestion/rust_pipeline/tasks.md`.

4.  **Mandatory Update:** **Crucially, after you have successfully implemented code or completed an action that fulfills a task listed in `DataIngestion/rust_pipeline/tasks.md`, you MUST update the corresponding task line in the `DataIngestion/rust_pipeline/tasks.md` file by changing its checkbox from `[ ]` to `[x]`.**

5.  **Confirmation:** In your response after completing and updating a task, explicitly state that you have updated `DataIngestion/rust_pipeline/tasks.md`. For example: "I have implemented the feature and updated `DataIngestion/rust_pipeline/tasks.md` to mark task X.Y as complete."
