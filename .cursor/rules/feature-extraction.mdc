**AI Assistant Directive:**  
For all feature engineering tasks in this project:
- Use the Dockerfile at `DataIngestion/feature_extraction/feature/feature.dockerfile`.
- Use `uv` for all Python dependency management and script execution.
- All database access must go through `db_utils.py` in the same directory as your feature scripts.
- The main entrypoint for feature extraction is `extract_features.py`.
- When running locally, use `uv run python extract_features.py` inside the Docker container.
- All configuration, data, and output directories should be mounted as volumes for reproducibility.

- Feature engineering should use `tsfresh` and may compare with other time-series feature libraries as needed.
